# Title:CDP_ex08_strategy
# Purpose : Create an interface to implement the Electricity and Gas classes as a strategy
# Instructions : Currently there are two classes that support an implementation
#                cost for that energy type. It would make better sense if that
#                implementation were expressed as a strategy, allowing for greater
#                flexibility should other Types be introduced
#                Implement an Energy Interface and add use it with Electricity and Gas
#                Verify that they return solid values, can you add another class to
#                support wind with the same algorithm, extend the functionality to
#                a CostManager class that  will give the result of the estimation
