# Title: TDD_ex02_searcher
# Purpose : To implement Test driven development principles
# Instructions : Create a function that searches objects in a list by taking a user input as the search term
#                specification,
#                A user entry of zero or one chars is invalid
#                For user entries of two or more chars there should be a return of all objects that start
#                with or contains the user input
#                the search should be case insensitive
#                if the user enters only * then all objects are returned

#               NOTE : A boilerpolate code file is provided, Baretest.py decompose the requirement to GWT then
#                   implement the code using TDD

#TODO Implement the feature
