# Title: CDP_ex11_ocp
# Purpose : To exercise refactoring to introduce Open closed principle
# Instructions : The code below generates a cost report for multiple energy
#               services based on thier unit cost, standing charge, and use.
#               Adding a new service such as fiber would either require
#               adding it into the EnergyServiceCostCalculator as an option
#               or refactoring the code to make it OCP compliant.
#               Review the code and using an abstract class to define an interface
#               to return a value can you add the fiber service that has a granular
#               calculation where there is a morning service rate and an afternoon
#               service rate
