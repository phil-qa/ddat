# Title: TDD_ex01_leap_year
# Purpose : To implement Test driven development principles
# Instructions : Create a feature to take a user input for a year value and respond if it is a
#                leap year or not
#                The rules for a leap year are :
#                it is a leap year if the year is divisible by 4
#                except if the year is divisible by 100 then it is not a leap year
#                unless the year is divisible by 400 then it is a leap year
#                implement the feature using tdd principles. Isolate the elements and consider the GWT construct

#               NOTE : A boilerpolate code file is provided, Baretest.py

#TODO Implement the feature
